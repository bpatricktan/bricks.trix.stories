				<p>The morning after was a little better. The rain hadn’t stopped completely but at least the winds weren’t as furious as last night, also the power was back so hooray for that! The WiFi was still dead though, but at least now I could charge my stuff. </p>
				
				<p>The sun decided to show itself just a little after breakfast, giving us the chance to check out the aftermath of nature’s carnage. Fallen trees and scattered debris, the animals seemed to have went on with their day like the storm never happened though. A huge gaping hole was ripped from the top of the house, almost half the entire roof, stretching from the master bedroom to right on top of what was the guest bedroom, or in this case, my bedroom. Uncle just scratched his head and laughed, it was a weird way to react to something like that, but maybe it was because compared to the storm 3 years ago, at least this time half the house didn’t collapse. </p>
				
				<p>“It’s a good thing we were downstairs huh Eira?” He smiled, still staring at the damage, placing his hand over my shoulder.  </p>
				
				<p>Mom and Dad arrived ten past noon, they had driven on when the road was safe, some time around five in the morning.   </p>
				
				<p>“HOLY SHIT! What happened here?!” My Mom yelled as they pulled in through the front gate in our mud stained 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. My Aunt was with them at the back seat. They had picked her up from the hospital on the way here.  “Benjie, what happened to your roof?”</p>
				
				<p>“It can be fixed! Don’t’ worry about it so much Amy.” My Uncle assured. </p>
				
				<p>“At least everyone is safe.” Said my Aunt Clara, hugging me tightly before giving one to Uncle before going inside the house. </p>
				
				<p>Mom just shook her head “At least let us help you out with the cost of reconstructing.”</p>
				
				<p>“Ohw pish posh booly hoodle” Uncle just waved her away “Keep your wallet in your purse. We can handle.” He laughed. “Besides it would look bad on me, accepting money from my little sister.”Uncle jokingly whispered to Mom before hugging her. </p>
				
				<p>“Well if there’s anything you need just tell us alright Ben? We’re always happy to help family out.” Dad said as he patted Uncle on the back.</p>
				
				<p>“Of course Robert, will do!” Uncle laughed “Now come on inside, I cooked you guys my famous goat meat stew.”</p>
				
				<p>Lunch was pretty lively today. Everyone exchanged stories over the table about their experience during last night’s storm. Aunt Clara said it was chaos over at the hospital, everyone panicked because the generators took quite a while to kick in. Mom and Dad ended up staying at some shady motel at a truck stop. Mom said she couldn’t really sleep all too well, with that dead lizard she found under her pillow and from all the giant roaches crawling about with their icky tiny legs. Mostly though, she said she couldn’t sleep because of Dad’s snoring. She described it as a war between the thunder outside and my Dad. </p>
				
				<p>It started to get dark out again, all the story sharing and laughing made the day seem to go by so fast. Uncle said it was about time they switched the lights on. Finally, since we weren’t able to yesterday from the black out. </p>
				
				<p>“It would feel a little less like Christmas Eve without the lights.” It was my Uncles favorite part of it all, the lights, like all the stars of every color decided to come down from the sky to share their radiance around this time of every year. “It’s a good thing the power decided to come back in time” </p>
				
				<p>We gathered around the living room, recollecting stories of years past, lamenting on the fact that Uncle’s son couldn’t make it home in time for Christmas this year. He worked on a cruise liner and this was their first Christmas apart. Then we all shared our plans for the future. This would be my last Christmas before I was shipped off to University but I wasn’t too worried, I knew I would be back next year.</p>
				
				<p>The rest of the family finally started to arrive one after the other. Uncle Tony and his family flew in from the middle east, Aunt Maria and her family also flew in from England, Uncle Bo and his new Australian girlfriend, I think this was his 4th girlfriend in three years, he thinks this time he’s fund “the one”, then there was Aunt Josephine, single and not that ready to mingle after her last marriage fell apart quite badly. There was also Grandpa Lucius, he was a funny guy, really nice and friendly too! You would be surprised to find out he’s a retired army general. Aunt Clara’s siblings and their families also arrived, plus a bunch of other people that I’m not really sure of anymore if they’re family or just random neighbors. Large extended families.  </p>
				
				<p>Midnight fast approached as we began to countdown to Christmas. It was a tradition for us to open presents during the final minutes that counted down to Christmas. The twins got a pair of iPads from Aunt and Uncle, and money from my parents. Mom and Dad didn’t really know how to pick gifts for kids other than myself.  This year I got a new laptop from my parents, to replace that relic I’ve been putting up with for the past half decade. Though I think I should have just asked for a mountain bike. Aunt Clara made me a new sweater and UncleBenjie got me an air rifle with my name etched on the stock, so that I could, as he put it “Finally join him and his kids on their yearly holiday dinner hunts.” Of course to the protests of my mother who strongly believed that girls shouldn’t play with such things. Clearly mother has never had fun trying to hunt for dinner. Dad was excited though. He used to join UncleBenjie and grandpa Lucius on their hunts that last few years. </p>
				
				<p>The clock struck 12 midnight and it was now officially Christmas. “Merry Christmas!” Everyone greeted each other, plenty of hugs and kisses to go around.</p>
				
				<p>It started to rain again.</p>
