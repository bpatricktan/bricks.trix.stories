				<p>“Let it snow! Let it Snow Let it snow…”</p>
				
				<p>You could hear every child sing, radio station play, and store speakers blast every year on the months leading up to the 25th of December, while children dreamt of “A White Christmas” as they called it. It’s awesome for the people that live in countries so far away from the imaginary heat line called the equator that they actually get to experience such a thing every winter. For the rest of us though, snow is somewhat like the fabled Unicorn. You’d like to believe that one day through some totally improbable miracle, you’d get to see one of them prancing down a double rainbow that flew all the way from the Alps of Switzerland or something like that. Then there strikes the painful reality that most of us may never ever ever see or touch or smell or even taste that unicorn… I mean Snow… In our short life spans! It’s just something most of us have to accept, sadly.</p>
				
				<p>For you see, while those people, who live in said lands far north of the ring of fiery hell, who actually do get blessed with wintery white goodness, we on the other hand get our yearly fill of… Rain.</p>

				<p>I mean don’t get me wrong, the rain is fine and all, you know. It cools down the weather giving us all a bit of a break from that scorching heat, and I mean SCORCHING! Oh and don’t even get me started on the humidity. Seriously. It’s like sitting in an oven in the middle of a sauna that’s been pre-heated since forever. Also the plants and farms need the rain too and stuff like that, I guess. Other than those reasons though I can’t seem to think of anything else good about the rain, just a bunch of bad things and inconveniences like floods, traffic due to those floods, people losing their shit from being stuck in traffic for hours because of those floods, disgusting indoor swimming pools, power outages, loss of internet connection. Oh God the horrors! Also the thought of being stuck inside all day because classes had been suspended and there is absolutely nowhere to go? </p>

				<p>Okay, actually that last one doesn’t sound too bad.</p>

				<p> Today was another one of those dreadful rainy days, except this one was supposedly a storm, and a big one at that, or at least according to the weather guys who seem to get their predictions right only about one percent of the time.</p>

				<p>I sat on an old wooden chair, hunched over with my arms resting on the windowpane, staring at my reflection as the rain fell in the background. Power was out again so there was nothing much to do. I had already wasted my phone battery earlier trying to conquer this one stubborn idiot Marquee826 on Clash of Clans. Annihilated the sap right before my phone died though, so I’m pretty happy it lasted ‘til then at least. </p>

				<p>No phone, no internet, no TV, nothing to do and nowhere to go. I mean where exactly can you go in a small provincial town in Nueva Vizcaya located in an over sized earthy basin called the Cagayan valley that’s three to four hours away from the closest Mall?</p>

				<p>A knock came on my door, it was my Uncle Tino. </p>

				<p>“Here’s your breakfast Eira.” He said.</p>

				<p>My uncle carefully made his way in, back first, holding a plate of his famous scrambled eggs and hash browns sitting on top a bed of secret recipe pancakes (The secret is his homegrown berries but don’t tell anyone I told you, okay?)  </p>

				<p>He placed the plate on the desk next to me and I dug in to it as soon as the plate touched down. Eating here was one of so little things to look forward to whenever we visited my uncle. So yeah, I was pretty much excited to eat.</p>

				<p>“Better than that IHOP you got back in Manila huh?” He joked followed by a hearty laugh.</p>

				<p>“You know nothing beats your pancakes!” I said, my mouth half full with that fluffy goodness.</p>

				<p>Really though, nothing did. Call me biased but I genuinely believed that nothing could beat his cooking. You wouldn’t know it, but he was like Gordon fuckin’ Ramsay. That is if Gordon Ramsay was a tad overweight, sported a buzz cut and a greasy tattered white shirt with an equally torn up face towel resting over his right shoulder. </p>

				<p>“Oh you’re exaggerating!” He laughed “But if you love it so much there’s still a lot more in the kitchen”</p>

				<p>My Uncle always did have the habit of cooking way too much. He patted his heavy hand on my shoulder and left me alone to finish my meal.</p>

				<p>I should probably mention that my uncle is a cop… slash carpenter slash mechanic slash farmer slash chef. A Jack of all trades, if you will. I mean officially he was a police officer in this region, often acting as right hand to numerous police superintendants, colonels and generals. He was the go to man for the top brass, be it on official police business or finding them a plot of land in the mountains to build their house on. He was offered a promotion on countless occasions, according to Mom.  He turned them down every single time. He never liked the idea of moving to the city permanently. I mean he had a nice, quiet, peaceful life up here and why would you want to trade that to live in a pit of snakes, as he put it, and he definitely did not want to be anywhere near those corrupt pigs in headquarters.</p>

				<p>I contemplated going down to get another plate of food, but I guess the weather had just made me feel so damn lazy. Rainy weather really does that to you. I decided to dig out that one Neil Gaiman book I’d been meaning to finish, a little over a hundred pages to reach the end but I’m guessing that I would probably be asleep within three pages.  I would never get the chance to read a single paragraph though.</p>

				<p>The winds picked up the pace, whistling a fife through the tiny gaps in the windows.  The rain fell even harder like drums of war to signal a full on charge. The roof rattled so much you’d think it would fly off at any moment. We were now facing the full force of the storm and it was scary as hell. I guess this was one of those forecasts that actually landed under that one percent. Those weather guys must be feeling real proud of themselves right now.</p>

				<p>A sudden blinding bolt flashed outside my window swiftly followed by a tirade of explosive megaton thunder bombs. Uncle Tino came up a few moments later, inviting me to join everyone else downstairs in the living room. I took him up on the offer. I mean, who would be crazy enough to want to be alone during Astrape and Bronte’s carpet bomb runs. Astrape and Bronte, if you did not know are twin goddesses of thunder and lightning in Greek mythology. </p>

				<p>I huddled around an oil lamp in the center of the living room with my cousins, Uncle Tino’s daughters, Kara and Mia, they were twins, if you hadn’t already guessed from their names. We shared stories, random stories, random creepy stories that I would soon love to forget. Uncle Tino was sitting by the window talking to Aunt Clara, his wife, on the phone. I was pretty amazed he was able to get a cell signal in this weather. She was stranded at the hospital where she worked in. Aunt Clara is the Head Nurse over there. She probably had it better off over there though. I could feel the house start to shake in its foundations.</p>

				<p>The storm raged on throughout the rest of the day. We couldn’t really do much but play a bunch of board games and share a bunch of stories. Game of Life really ate up most of our time, that and Monopoly. We drank so much hot cocoa, with these humongous marshmallows. I’ve already lost count of how many cups I’ve had. Soon enough the sun had gone down, you couldn’t really tell except that the dark gray skies soon turned to pitch black. The nightmare had turned into a full blown horror film. Or so it seemed to me anyway. </p>

				<p>The rattling had gotten louder. The noises outside have gotten even creepier with the moaning of the wind squeezing through the gaps. It amazed me how the Twins were able to sleep so soundly through all this, snuggled together on a king sized mattress my Uncle had placed on the floor for us to sleep in. I pretty much preferred the couch, though. Uncle was on his wooden rocking chair next to the window, having fallen asleep while trying to watch Mother Nature batter us with all her fury through the cover of night. All I could see in the infinite darkness were our shadows, eerily dancing to the waving of the flame burning from the oil lamp which now sat on the coffee table in the middle of the room.</p>

				<p>There comes a time in one’s life where you learn that one cannot drink five or so mugs of hot chocolate without expecting it to come out sooner or later. Fuck this, seriously, I thought the rain would have stopped before night fell, and now it seems I had to venture forth into Silent Hill just to take a piss. I guess I’ll just try to sleep.</p>

				<p>Heavy rainfall battled raging winds outside as Eira Margaret Cross awakes, groggily, finding herself in a dark room in an abandoned building in the middle of a silent and deserted town in the valley. Dazed and confused, she struggled to pull herself up off the dusty wooden floor, she reached out her hands, blindly feeling her way in the darkness, trying to find something to grab on to for leverage. She touched something on the floor with her open palm, something wet, but it wasn’t water, it did not feel like water, it was too thick and smelled of iron. Blood? But whose? Hers? She felt around her body with her hand to find a source, a wound, nothing on her body, nothing on her face, her head or her limbs. She wasn’t having her period either. It wasn’t her blood then. She felt a bit relieved.</p>

				<p>Eira carefully felt her way around the room with only the light of the night sky providing light through the window. She tripped on something and fell towards the desk were she found a flashlight sitting on top of it. Eira surveyed the room with her flashlight, only now being able to fully examine it. She found her best friend, dead on the ground next to where she lay. Her throat had been ripped open and her innards devoured and ravaged.</p>

				<p>A sense of shock and horror filled in Eira as the tears involuntarily welled up in her eyes. The sight was too gruesome for her, she was not able to hold in what was building up inside of her and she spewed it all over the wooden floor. The feeling of horror now gripped Eira ever tighter. She knew there was little time to grieve though. She knew she needed to find a way out of there, lest she wish to suffer the same fate as her friend. Was this the fate that awaited her? She pondered. No. She did not want it to end like that. She would at least try to find a way out. </p>

				<p>Eira ventured through the lone door in the room that led to a long hallway that seemed to stretch for half of a kilometer with another door waiting on the other end. </p>

				<p>The hall had an eerie feeling in the air, it felt too quiet, besides the moaning of the wind squeezing through the little gaps, the pattering of the drops of rain on the sheet metal roof overhead, and the creaking of the wood panel floors beneath Eira’s feet as she walked down the hall. Step by careful step, creak by tiny creak. She tried to walk while making the least noise as she possibly could so as not to awaken the evil that lurked in these shadows. She really felt deep down in her gut that someone, or something, was watching her from a dark corner.</p>

				<p>Something rolled in front of Eira. It shined a brilliant blue. She knelt down to pick it up and that’s when she noticed, she had stopped moving but the creaking had not. A sense of heightened fear filled in Eira as she remained frozen on the floor. She turned around slowly to try and see what was behind her, if anything was behind her. The creaking stopped. Right then, something small, something hairy caressed her leg. Eira jumped in a panic, causing her flashlight to fall to the ground. The noise of the clash of plastic and wood echoed through the hall, swiftly followed by silence. The silence would not last long though for soon the ground beneath her began to shake violently. The ceiling began to crack and chip off, falling all around her. She ran, throwing caution to the wind now. If anything planned on coming for her they surely would have been coming for her now. She ran and ran as fast as she could, bursting through the door and shutting it quickly. She was safe. Or so she mistakenly thought.</p>

				<p>Before her, stood a monster, a Minotaur? No. It towered over eight feet tall and dragged a mighty battle-axe behind it. The beast had the torso of a gorilla that was connected to the body of a large Lion, It had a head of what looked like a Rhino and three snakes for a tail. The beast’s eyes glowed bloody crimson, its flesh decayed and reeked of the horrible stench of death. The earth shook with every step it took, and with it, chunks of its disgusting flesh would fall and splatter to the floor. It was a great monster from legend. A Chimera. </p>

				<p>The monster bellowed a thunderous roar, sending Eira tumbling to the ground; her skin, burnt by its saliva that burned like acid. It edged closer and closer, backing Eira to the wall. There was nowhere left to go. Nowhere left to run. This would be the end, and Eira accepted it, albeit reluctantly. The Chimera raised its mighty battle-axe high and with one swift, powerful, downward swing, Eira was split in half.</p>

				<p>Okay so maybe Eira liked to fantasize a lot, and okay maybe Eira likes to refer to herself in the third person sometimes. I bet you do that too sometimes, right? No? Okay just me then. But hey come on! Would you rather I tell you that I just woke up in the middle of the night because I needed to use the toilet? Or that the toilet was just a few feet away from the living room? Or that my dead “best friend” was just my dead smart phone? It WAS dark and scary though, but there was no Chimera, no Minotaur, nor any kind of Monster for that matter, lurking in the shadows, just a really big rat. Okay so it was a tiny field mouse, but come on it was dark! </p>

				<p>I don’t think I’m going to be drinking anything more tonight, or even think about taking a shower for that matter. At least now I can go back to sleep with all certainty that I won’t be having any accidents on this couch tonight.</p>
