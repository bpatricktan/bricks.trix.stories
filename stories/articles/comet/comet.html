				<p>A mysterious face of a young woman greeted me as my vision slowly began to clear from a blur. Her face hovered a breath away from mine, as she leaned in close enough that I could feel the warmth seeping out of her skin. The sweet scent of her perfume shrouded her, a mixed fragrance of apples and vanilla. Her eyes struck me as they peered deeply into my own, shimmering a brilliant hue reminiscent the calm sapphire waters of the ocean sparkling in the sun. it would seem that one would drown in them if stared deeply for too long. </p>

				<p>“Seriously, Lucas.” She said to me. Her words had a mix of annoyance and disappointment, I could hear it masked behind her lowered voice that was as calm as the whispers of the midnight air. “You’ve basically slept through the entire trip.”</p>

				<p>She stared at me in silence, only for a moment, before a gentle curve formed on her lips. She then proceeded to comb her hair with the tips of her fingers; sliding along her long wavy strands, black on the roots that transitioned smoothly to a lighter shade of brown at the tips, which sat just a finger length below the back of her shoulders. </p>

				<p>“You’re missing out on all the beautiful nature and stuff.” She added.</p>

				<p>I found myself lost and confused. A thousand questions circled in my head, amongst them repeated a few: where was I? Where were we going? How did we get here?  </p>

				<p>It felt as though I were suspended in a moment, as if all time had stopped to give me enough of a chance to take in everything around me: The dim blue of the ambient lighting that ran across the ceiling, barely lighting up the darkness of the night, though bright enough to reflect my image on the large window to my right that climbed from my chest all the way up to the ceiling. The air was cold and dry, seeping through the air conditioning vents from overhead, pervading throughout the cabin with a striking aroma of lemon scented air freshener that stuck to the fabric of the thick cushioned seats, and stung sharply at the back of my nose. There was a faint rattling of metal that echoed from all around, mixed with a calm silence, disturbed only by the burst of an occasional snoreand the uncontrollable cries of infant children. I was on a train. </p>

				<p>My attention soon turned back to the large window as I stared past my faded reflection and into the blackened silhouettes of the distant landscape and that dark, starless night sky. I dug my phone out from deep within the right hand side pocket of my charcoal gray jeans that were beginning to get a little too tight for me. 4:57 read the clock boldly in white as I awoke my phone from hibernation just to check the time after noticing my watch had stopped working. Sunrise was still an hour or so away.</p>

				<p>“How is anyone supposed to see any of that so called ‘beautiful nature’ in the cover of that darkness?” I finally asked with a somewhat annoyed tone in my voice, a by-product of the grogginess that comes as a result of being so rudely awakened so abruptly. </p>

				<p>“Night vision!” She said jokingly with such a playful tune in her voice as she mockingly formed binoculars with her hands.</p>

				<p>I scoffed, though only light enough for me to hear, before my thoughts wandered back to that dream I had earlier. It was so vivid. So… real. Almost like a memory being played back. To me, though, it still felt like I was still in a dream, a rare occurrence of consciousness suspended between reality and fantasy. </p>

				<p>The questions began to circle back around my head, though one question stood out now more than it had: Who was this young woman sitting next to me? She acts as though we were somehow acquainted. Maybe we were? Maybe we had met early on this trip? I doubted it. She spoke to me as though we’ve known each other for quite some time. An old schoolmate perhaps?Or a colleague from one of my previous jobs? She did look strikingly familiar, though I found it difficult to place a name on her.</p>

				<p>“Hey, are you alright?” She asked, her words pulling me back from the trenches of my own thoughts.  </p>

				<p>I apologized. </p>

				<p>The gentle curve once again formed on her face, her front teeth peeping slightly through the small gap in her pink lips, which had begun to crack from the cold, dry air. She placed her hand so lightly on the side of my face, just over my ear, it was soft and smooth and cold to the touch. She then slid her hand across the side of my head, brushing my hair with her fingers gently gliding along over my ear and to the back of my head. </p>

				<p>“You’ve only fallen asleep for a few hours and already you’ve forgotten me?” She said, shaking her head slightly in disappointment. It confused me even more.</p>

				<p>“Well then I shall indulge you.” She laughed ever so lightly, extending an open right hand in a formal offer of greetings. “You can call me Fate… and you are?”</p>

				<p>“Lucas.” I said awkwardly as I stuttered to shake her hand. “My name is Lucas.”</p>
				
				<p>“Well, Lucas, it’s an absolute pleasure to meet you.” She said.</p>
				
				<p>“Likewise.” Was all I managed to reply, soon followed by a deafening silence as I caught myself awkwardly staring at her staring back at me.</p>
				
				<p> “So.” She said. Breaking the silence in the air, her eyes fixed firmly onto mine. </p>
				
				<p>“So… what?” I asked quite stupidly.</p>
				
				<p>“Well, I don’t know. Is that it?” She asked, almost as if she were somehow expecting more before suddenly being weighed down with disappointment as she turned her attention blackness outside my window before turning her eyes back to me. “So much for first impressions, I guess.” She whispered to herself, just barely loud enough for me to hear.</p>
				
				<p>I was never all too good at holding up a conversation. Especially with someone I knew little to nothing of. Starting a conversation was always the easy part, despite how much preparation was required to conjure up a plan of action: the approach to be taken, the words to be said. Though when those words finally do manage to escape through my lips, the structure of the sentence would always come out so jumbled from originally intended. Then by some miracle I manage to garner a response, carrying the conversation without coming off as strange would so often prove to be a task near impossible.</p>
				
				<p>“Wait, I’m sorry.” I managed to apologize once more without stuttering.  “I’m just very confused at the moment.” I told her, while my face mirrored that fact.</p>
				
				<p>“Yeah. I know. I’m actually pretty confused myself.” She said to me, briefly pausing before suddenly bursting out in laughter, barely containing it as not to be too loud as to wake up the sleeping cabin.</p>
				
				<p>To be quite honest though, I really was terribly confused, like a chunk of my memory had just been suddenly deleted. My head began to throb in pain as I pushed hard to try and remember even the smallest detail. I paused for a moment to clear my mind. I though back to the last thing I could bring myself to remember.</p>
				
				<p>The Champions League final.</p>
				
				<p>I remember watching it with the guys at some sports bar in Makati. I remembered as we witnessed Barcelona demolish Juventus as we went crazy with the alcohol. A wealth of farfetched scenarios played out in my head as my imagination began to run wild. I though that maybe, just maybe, we had ended up drinking a tad too much alcohol which led to me forgetting everything that happened after. That would explain the blackout in my memory, I suppose. Dear god, don’t tell me. Was she there that night as well? Were be both so drunk out of our minds that we ended up getting married in some sort of shotgun style wedding, which somehow lead up to us getting on this train bound for some provincial town miles away from civilization to meet her parents, set to spend the rest of my pathetic life working on some hillbilly cornfield? It was the most logical explanation.</p>
				
				<p>“That is one wild imagination you’ve got there, my friend.” She interrupted my thoughts. She wore a perplexed look on her face as she stared me up and down. “Also, it’s not some hillbilly cornfield, okay?” She said, pausing for a moment before revealing--  “It’s a redneck mango farm.”</p>
				
				<p>I squinted my eyes at her in utter disbelief, sinking my head down soon after to look at my knees, averting my eyes from her gaze as the realization swiftly dawned upon me that I had probably just narrated my thoughts out loud. Did I really just say all that? I asked myself again. Also, what exactly would a redneck mango farm look like exactly? I wondered.</p>
				
				<p>“Yes, you did just say all that out loud.” She said to me with her brow raised. “And you’re still doing it by the way.”</p>
				
				<p>A puffing sigh escaped her, before shaking her head in what seemed like utter disappointment. The cloud of a painfully awkward silence returned. I proceeded to fidget around with my phone, not exactly doing anything in particular, just pretending to look busy by staring blankly at my screen, swiping randomly across the tabs on my phone before scrolling though old text messages (mostly ads from the cell company advertising their latest scams-- excuse me,‘promotions’). </p>
				
				<p>“So…” She said, breaking the silence once more. “You really don’t remember, huh?”</p>
				
				<p>She had a serious tone in her voice that hinted of something which scared me. My heart began palpitating,seemingly trying to pound its way right out of my chest from pure anxiety.</p>
				
				<p>“Well then, I guess I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but…” She started, pausing for a brief moment to look down at her now naked feet, anxiously swinging her legs back and forth before continuing. “…but It’s exactly as you said.”</p>
				
				<p>“What do you mean?” I asked, now even more confused than I started out as the anxiety continued to eat away at me. </p>
				
				<p>She turned her body towards me now. Her eyes stared at my direction, though not exactly at me. No. Her gaze shot through me to the shadowy landscape outside my window as she started to recall the events of that fateful night.</p>
				
				<p>“We both had one too many drinks that night. I had just gotten off a horrible break up and I guess you did too. We were both just going crazy with the crowd, drunk stupid out of our minds, just enjoying the night as we watched Barca lift the Champions League trophy all while mocking our poor friends that supported Juve. Then all so suddenly you confused your love for me even though we had only met barely two hours before then. I remember you say to me: life was all too short for us to waste the chances that come our way and that we had to just grab them! So we got married in a shotgun wedding ceremony in Little Vegas. Your two friends, who were most likely too stoned and, or, too drunk to stay completely conscious were witnesses, along with a homeless guy that was probably just sleeping in the chapel to escape the rain outside, and for some reason there was also a goat there. Don’t ask me why. I don’t know why there was a goat there but it was just there. So now we’re on this train. On our way to meet my parents to whom you promised to devote the rest of your life working away at our hillbilly cornfields.” </p>
				
				<p>“Hold on. Sorry. Excuse me for just a second here—“ I interjected this time. “—but I thought you said your parents owned a redneck mango farm.” </p>
				
				<p>“Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexactly!” She said. Winking at me as she stuck her tongue out to the side.</p>
				
				<p>God help me. I screamed in my head, questioning how I could even be so gullible as to believe such a crazy story? I knew it was a little too far fetched. I mean, come on! Little Vegas? A goat? What?</p>
				
				<p>“Most of the time, we plan trips to escape the trivial problems that plague our day to day lives.” Fate began to speak, adjusting her seat a bit, trying to find a comfortable enough position. “And sometimes we are forced out on a journey in order to find something, either in ourselves or in something else entirely. This, my dear Lucas, would be the latter. So a word of advice, just go with it, and you might just find whatever it is you so desperately seek, or you may not. Either way, you might as well try to enjoy it for the most part, yeah?”</p>
				
				<p>She then proceeded to wrap herself in a plaid cotton blanket patterned in purple and white squares with black borderlines, before finally resting her head on a small pillow she placed on my shoulder.</p>
				
				<p>“You should probably sleep a bit more.” She said to me. “We’re still a little over five hours away, if I’m not mistaken.”</p>
				
				<p> I looked at her, smiling up at me from my shoulder with that now familiar curve of her lips. She cuddled up to a larger pillow she clutched in her arms, pulling it close to her chest, then she turned her head to look outside the window. The sun now began to peek out over the distant horizon, the purple silhouettes of trees, the wide open fields that stretched far out into the mountains in the distance, all of it formed the landscape foreground to a warm orange sky in the background. The view invoked memories of days from my youth long gone with the passage of time, when my parents would drag my sister and I out of the city at least once every summer to my father’s home town in the province in the middle of Cagayan Valley. This now all felt somehow familiar. The cold, dry air seeping from the air conditioning vents overhead, pervading throughout the cabin with the striking aroma of lemon scented air freshener that stuck to the fabric of the thick cushioned seats. The faint sounds rattling metals and the sliding of looses luggage scraping the overhead compartments, all these noises mixed with the relaxing silence of a cabin filled with exhausted passengers lost so deeply in their slumber. Indeed it all felt so familiar.</p>
				
				<p>“You could at least tell me where we were going.” I said, my words falling on deaf ears as I turned to find Fate now deep asleep.</p>
				
				<p>“What a time to fall asleep.” I whispered to myself now, looking at the face of this strange young woman now lost in the deepest levels of sleep as her head rested on a pillow on my shoulder, preventing me from making any large and sudden movements. I turned my attention to the view outside my window as I found the shades of purple had now taken on a more colourful palette and the once brilliant orange now turned cerulean. </p>
				
				<p>“You’re missing out on all the beautiful nature and stuff.”</p>
