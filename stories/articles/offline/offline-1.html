				<p>The sun’s rays slipped through the spaces of the blinds in Emily’s room, just about hitting her right in the face.</p>

				<p>Emily grunted as she lazily grabbed the clock on her bedside table.</p>

				<p>“7:30” she rumbled “It’s still so early” she complained, making disapproving faces as she slithered back under her blanket.</p>

				<p>She just laid there for a good 10 minutes, just staring at the colourful formations on her blanket, of which were lit up from the sunlight. Finally she sat up on her bed, messy bed hair and all. Her auburn hair was all over the place, like a tree that had just been battered by a typhoon. Her bangs covered her sparkly blue gems for eyes. </p>

				<p>The sandman had paid her a visit the night before, and it seemed that he had sprinkled a little too much of his magic sleeping sand. Rubbing her eyes vigorously, she tried to force them open; quite painfully if I might add for they seemed to be shut down tight as if they were glued together. Emily stretched her arms wide as she gave a long and loud yawn, patting her hand on her wide open mouth. Then she just sat there, and chapped her mouth -as if chewing on bubble gum- as she looked around the room. She gave another long yawn before finally jumping out of bed.</p>

				<p> Slowly, and sloppily, she walked into the bathroom. She flipped on the lights to be greeted by what felt to be the burning sensation of a thousand solar flares on her eyes.</p>

				<p>“GAH!!!” she yelled from the pain “sonofa…” placing her hands over her eyes to try and stop the light from making direct contact with them. She stood in front of the mirror and just looked at herself, sort of going into a trance for 5 minutes before realizing she was standing there staring at herself like an idiot. </p>

				<p>“squeak squeak” the sound the knobs made as she let the shower run and heat up. A few minutes later she walked right in and yelled at the top of her lungs “HOT!!!”</p>

				<p>After letting the water cool back down she took a shower (for an hour, give or take), brushed her teeth (Yes, also in the shower) and the rest of her morning routines (do I really need to explain all of them?)</p>

				<p>~*moments later*~</p>

				<p>Emily walked out of the bathroom, all clean and minty fresh, the aroma of her rosy scent filling the moist air. A towel wrapped around her head to dry her hair, and a soft, fluffy bathrobe to keep her body warm. She slowly made her way to her dresser, before running back into the bathroom</p>

				<p>*flush*</p>

				<p>She got dressed and sat back down on her bed for a few minutes to think about what she should do that day.</p>

				<p>Nothing came to mind and she collapsed on her back with a huge puffing sigh exhaled from her mouth. “what to do what to do what to do?” she asked herself as she stared at her phone. A picture of her and Allen decorated her phone’s background. </p>

				<p>“I wonder what you’re up to today.” She sighed as she put her phone down. Just then her phone rang. </p>

				<p>She answered the call, it was her friend, Beth, from class </p>

				<p>“Hey wanna hang out today?” Beth asked over the phone.</p>

				<p>“Sure! I was beginning to get bored” Emily replied</p>

				<p>“Alright then I’ll pick you up in a few minutes. GET READY!”</p>

				<p>“Ok then. see you in a bit” Emily said excitingly as she hung up the phone.</p>
